# Cursor-using-hand-gesture ✋🖱️

## Project Overview

[cite_start]This project is dedicated to developing an innovative gesture-based cursor control system [cite: 2] [cite_start]that empowers users to navigate and interact with computer interfaces through intuitive hand gestures, eliminating the need for traditional input devices[cite: 2]. [cite_start]By integrating advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, this system aims to enhance human-computer interaction (HCI) by providing a more accessible, intuitive, and engaging user experience for real-time gesture recognition[cite: 3, 4, 5].

## Key Features 🌟

* [cite_start]**Real-time Hand Movement Capture:** Utilizes OpenCV to capture live hand movements from a camera feed[cite: 7, 15].
* [cite_start]**Gesture-to-Cursor Translation:** Translates detected hand gestures into precise cursor actions, including movement, clicking, and scrolling[cite: 7].
* [cite_start]**Enhanced Human-Computer Interaction:** Offers an accessible and intuitive alternative to conventional input methods, broadening the scope of how users interact with technology[cite: 4, 5].

## Who are the End Users 🎯

* [cite_start]**Individuals with Disabilities:** Provides a significant benefit for users with limited mobility or difficulties using traditional mice or keyboards, enabling more accessible computer interaction[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Education Sector:** Teachers and students can leverage gesture control for interactive learning experiences, making presentations and educational tools more engaging[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]**Healthcare Professionals:** In critical hygiene environments like hospitals, gesture control minimizes the need for physical contact with devices, reducing contamination risks[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Industrial Applications:** Workers in hazardous environments can operate machines or computers without physical contact, enhancing safety and efficiency[cite: 12].

## Technologies Used 💻

* [cite_start]**Programming Language:** Python - Serves as the foundational programming language for all project functionalities[cite: 14]. 🐍
* [cite_start]**Computer Vision & Image Processing:** OpenCV - Essential for video capture, image processing, and gesture recognition[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]**Hand Tracking & Movement Detection:** MediaPipe - Used for recognizing faces, tracking hands, and detecting movements[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]**Geometric Measurement:** Util (custom library) - Created for measuring length and angles within figures[cite: 17].
* [cite_start]**GUI Automation:** PyAutoGUI - Used for controlling the mouse (movement, clicks) and screen capture[cite: 18].
