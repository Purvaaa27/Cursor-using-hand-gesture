# Cursor-using-hand-gesture ✋🖱️

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to developing an innovative gesture-based cursor control system that empowers users to navigate and interact with computer interfaces through intuitive hand gestures, eliminating the need for traditional input devices. By integrating advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, this system aims to enhance human-computer interaction (HCI) by providing a more accessible, intuitive, and engaging user experience for real-time gesture recognition.

## Key Features 🌟

**Real-time Hand Movement Capture:** Utilizes OpenCV to capture live hand movements from a camera feed.

**Gesture-to-Cursor Translation:** Translates detected hand gestures into precise cursor actions, including movement, clicking, and scrolling.

**Enhanced Human-Computer Interaction:** Offers an accessible and intuitive alternative to conventional input methods, broadening the scope of how users interact with technology.

## Who are the End Users 🎯

**Individuals with Disabilities:** Provides a significant benefit for users with limited mobility or difficulties using traditional mice or keyboards, enabling more accessible computer interaction.

**Education Sector:** Teachers and students can leverage gesture control for interactive learning experiences, making presentations and educational tools more engaging.

**Healthcare Professionals:** In critical hygiene environments like hospitals, gesture control minimizes the need for physical contact with devices, reducing contamination risks.

**Industrial Applications:** Workers in hazardous environments can operate machines or computers without physical contact, enhancing safety and efficiency.

## Technologies Used 💻

**Programming Language:** Python - Serves as the foundational programming language for all project functionalities. 🐍

**Computer Vision & Image Processing:** OpenCV - Essential for video capture, image processing, and gesture recognition.

**Hand Tracking & Movement Detection:** MediaPipe - Used for recognizing faces, tracking hands, and detecting movements.

**Geometric Measurement:** Util (custom library) - Created for measuring length and angles within figures.

**GUI Automation:** PyAutoGUI - Used for controlling the mouse (movement, clicks) and screen capture.
